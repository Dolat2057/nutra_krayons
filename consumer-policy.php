We have noticed that although a vast majority of our customers have genuine concerns, where we are always upfront to support; there are some accounts that abuse our liberal return and exchange policies. These accounts typically return items, choose not to accept our shipments or demand cashback for issues that we are not responsible for. Hence, our regular customers are deprived of the opportunity to purchase these products themselves. To protect the right of our customers, our customer care support team reserves the right to assess, judge and then take the necessary action at their discretion</p>
